# Command Line Challenges VM

## VM Setup
A linux-based virtual machine will be setup with the directory outlined in this Git repository. Each folder in this main directory corresponds to a different part or challenge in this series. Each folder will be encrypted with a password that's required to access the challenge contents. This password will be granted as each challenge is unlocked.

## VM Considerations
In the VM, the active user should be setup to have just enough privileges to complete the challenges. They shouldn't have excessive privileges to mitigate any "cheesing" of the challenges.

Additionally, use tools like gocryptfs to encrypt the folder.
